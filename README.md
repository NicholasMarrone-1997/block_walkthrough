Block Walkthrough - TryHackMe
In this detailed guide, you will learn how to analyze and decrypt encrypted SMB3 traffic using a combination of tools and techniques. Starting with the extraction and cracking of hashed passwords from a memory dump, the guide demonstrates how to calculate key exchange keys and random session keys, which are essential for decrypting SMB3 traffic captured in a PCAP file. You'll also explore the process of handling non-crackable hashes by modifying Python scripts, ultimately leading to the successful decryption and extraction of sensitive data from the network traffic.
